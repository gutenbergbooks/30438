<h1>THE EYES HAVE IT</h1>

<h2>By James McKimmey, Jr.</h2>

<p><small>Illustrated by Paul Orban</small></p></div></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Joseph Heidel</span> looked slowly
around the dinner table at
the five men, hiding his examination
by a thin screen of smoke from
his cigar. He was a large man with
thick blond-gray hair cut close to
his head. In three more months he
would be fifty-two, but his face and
body had the vital look of a man
fifteen years younger. He was the
President of the Superior Council,
and he had been in that post&mdash;the
highest post on the occupied planet
of Mars&mdash;four of the six years he
had lived here. As his eyes flicked
from one face to another his fingers
unconsciously tapped the table,
making a sound like a miniature
drum roll.</p>

<p>One. Two. Three. Four. Five.
Five top officials, selected, tested,
screened on Earth to form the
nucleus of governmental rule on
Mars.</p>

<p>Heidel's bright narrow eyes
flicked, his fingers drummed.
Which one? Who was the imposter,
the ringer? Who was the Martian?</p>

<p>Sadler's dry voice cut through the
silence: "This is not just an ordinary
meeting then, Mr. President?"</p>

<p>Heidel's cigar came up and was
clamped between his teeth. He
stared into Sadler's eyes. "No, Sadler,
it isn't. This is a very special
meeting." He grinned around the
cigar. "This is where we take
the clothes off the sheep and find
the wolf."</p>

<p>Heidel watched the five faces.
Sadler, Meehan, Locke, Forbes,
Clarke. One of them. Which one?</p>

<p>"I'm a little thick tonight," said
Harry Locke. "I didn't follow what
you meant."</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not," Heidel
said, still grinning. "I'll explain it."
He could feel himself alive at that
moment, every nerve singing, every
muscle toned. His brain was quick
and his tongue rolled the words out
smoothly. This was the kind of
situation Heidel handled best. A
tense, dramatic situation, full of atmosphere
and suspense.</p>

<p>"Here it is," Heidel continued,
"simply and briefly." He touched
the cigar against an ash tray, watching
with slitted shining eyes while
the ashes spilled away from the
glowing tip. He bent forward suddenly.
"We have an imposter
among us, gentlemen. A spy."</p>

<p>He waited, holding himself tense
against the table, letting the sting
of his words have their effect. Then
he leaned back, carefully. "And tonight
I am going to expose this imposter.
Right here, at this table."
He searched the faces again, looking
for a tell-tale twitch of a muscle,
a movement of a hand, a shading
in the look of an eye.</p>

<p>There were only Sadler, Meehan,
Locke, Forbes, Clarke, looking like
themselves, quizzical, polite, respecting.</p>

<p>"One of us, you say," Clarke said
noncommittally, his phrase neither
a question nor a positive statement.</p>

<p>"That is true," said Heidel.</p>

<p>"Bit of a situation at that," said
Forbes, letting a faint smile touch
his lips.</p>

<p>"Understatement, Forbes," Heidel
said. "Understatement."</p>

<p>"Didn't mean to sound capricious,"
Forbes said, his smile gone.</p>

<p>"Of course not," Heidel said.</p>

<p>Edward Clarke cleared his
throat. "May I ask, sir, how this
was discovered and how it was narrowed
down to the Superior Council?"</p>

<p>"Surely," Heidel said crisply.
"No need to go into the troubles
we've been having. You know all
about that. But how these troubles
originated is the important thing.
Do you remember the missionary
affair?"</p>

<p>"When we were going to convert
the Eastern industrial section?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Heidel said, remembering.
"Horrible massacre."</p>

<p>"Bloody," agreed John Meehan.</p>

<p>"Sixty-seven missionaries lost,"
Heidel said.</p>

<p>"I remember the Martian note
of apology," Forbes said. "'We
have worshipped our own God for
two-hundred thousand years. We
would prefer to continue. Thank
you.' Blinking nerve, eh?"</p>

<p>"Neither here nor there," Heidel
said abruptly. "The point is that no
one <i>knew</i> those sixty-seven men
were missionaries except myself and
you five men."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Heidel watched</span> the faces
in front of him. "One case,"
he said. "Here's another. Do you
recall when we outlawed the free
selection system?"</p>

<p>"Another bloody one," said Sadler.</p>

<p>"Forty-eight victims in that
case," Heidel said. "Forty-eight
honorable colonists, sanctioned by
us to legally marry any couple on
the planet, and sent out over the
country to abolish the horrible free-love
situation."</p>

<p>"Forty-eight justices of the peace
dead as pickerels," Forbes said.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to remember
<i>that</i> note of apology?" Heidel
asked, a slight edge in his voice.
He examined Forbes' eyes.</p>

<p>"Matter of fact, yes," said Forbes,
returning Heidel's stare steadily.
"'You love your way, we'll love
ours.' Terribly caustic, what?"</p>

<p>"Terribly," said Heidel. "Although
that too is neither here nor
there. The point again, no one except
the six of us right here knew
what those forty-eight men were
sent out to do."</p>

<p>Heidel straightened in his chair.
The slow grating voice of Forbes
had taken some of the sharpness
out of the situation. He wanted to
hold their attention minutely, so
that when he was ready, the dramatics
of his action would be tense
and telling.</p>

<p>"There is no use," he said, "in
going into the details of the other
incidents. You remember them.
When we tried to install a free
press, the Sensible Art galleries, I-Am-A-Martian Day,
wrestling, and
all the rest."</p>

<p>"I remember the wrestling business
awfully well," said Forbes.
"Martians drove a wrestler through
the street in a yellow jetmobile.
Had flowers around his neck and a
crown on his head. He was dead, of
course. Stuffed, I think...."</p>

<p>"All right," snapped Heidel.
"Each one of our efforts to offer
these people a chance to benefit
from our culture was snapped off
at the bud. And only a leak in the
Superior Council could have caused
it. It is a simple matter of deduction.
There is one of us, here tonight,
who is responsible. And I am
going to expose him." Heidel's
voice was a low vibrant sound that
echoed in the large dining room.</p>

<p>The five men waited. Forbes, his
long arms crossed. Sadler, his eyes
on his fingernails. Meehan, blinking
placidly. Clarke, twirling his
thumbs. Locke, examining his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Kessit!" Heidel called.</p>

<p>A gray-haired man in a black
butler's coat appeared.</p>

<p>"We'll have our wine now,"
Heidel said. There was a slight
quirk in his mouth, so that his teeth
showed between his lips. The butler
moved methodically from place to
place, pouring wine from a silver
decanter.</p>

<p>"Now then, Kessit," Heidel said,
when the butler had finished,
"would you be kind enough to fetch
me that little pistol from the mantel
over there?" He smiled outwardly
this time. The situation was
right again; he was handling things,
inch by inch, without interruption.</p>

<p>He took the gun from the old
man's hands. "One thing
more, Kessit. Would you please
light the candles on the table and
turn out the rest of the lights in
the room. I've always been a romanticist,"
Heidel said, smiling
around the table. "Candlelight with
my wine."</p>

<p>"Oh, excellent," said Locke soberly.</p>

<p>"Quite," said Forbes.</p>

<p>Heidel nodded and waited
while the butler lit the candles and
snapped off the overhead lights.
The yellow flames wavered on the
table as the door closed gently behind
the butler.</p>

<p>"Now, then," Heidel said, feeling
the tingling in his nerves. "This,
gentlemen, is a replica of an antique
of the twentieth century. A
working replica, I might add. It
was called a P-38, if my memory
serves me." He held the pistol up
so that the candlelight reflected
against the glistening black handle
and the blue barrel.</p>

<p>There was a polite murmur as
the five men stretched forward to
look at the gun in Heidel's hands.</p>

<p>"Crude," Sadler said.</p>

<p>"But devilish-looking," Forbes
added.</p>

<p>"My hobby," Heidel said. "I
would like to add that not only do
I collect these small arms, but I am
very adept at using them. Something
I will demonstrate to you
very shortly," he added, grinning.</p>

<p>"Say now," nodded Meehan.</p>

<p>"That should be jolly," Forbes
said, laughing courteously.</p>

<p>"I believe it will at that," Heidel
said. "Now if you will notice, gentlemen,"
he said touching the clip
ejector of the pistol and watching
the black magazine slip out into his
other hand. "I have but five cartridges
in the clip. Just five. You
see?"</p>

<p>They all bent forward, blinking.</p>

<p>"Good," said Heidel, shoving the
clip back into the grip of the gun.
He couldn't keep his lips from curling
in his excitement, but his hands
were as steady as though his nerves
had turned to ice.</p>

<p>The five men leaned back in
their chairs.</p>

<p>"Now then, Meehan," he said to
the man at the opposite end of the
table. "Would you mind moving
over to your left, so that the end of
the table is clear?"</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Meehan. "Yes, of
course." He grinned at the others,
and there was a ripple of amusement
as Meehan slid his chair to
the left.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Heidel. "All pretty
foolish-looking, perhaps. But it
won't be in a few minutes when I
discover the bastard of a Martian
who's in this group, I'll tell you
that!" His voice rose and rang in
the room, and he brought the glistening
pistol down with a crack
against the table.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There was</span> dead silence and
Heidel found his smile again.
"All right, now I'll explain a bit
further. Before Dr. Kingly, the head
of our laboratory, died a few days
ago, he made a very peculiar discovery.
As you know, there has been
no evidence to indicate that the
Martian is any different, physically,
from the Earthman. Not until Dr.
Kingly made his discovery, that is."</p>

<p>Heidel looked from face to face.
"This is how it happened," he went
on. "Dr. Kingly ..."</p>

<p>He paused and glanced about in
false surprise. "I beg your pardon,
gentlemen. We might as well be enjoying
our wine. Excellent port.
Very old, I believe. Shall we?" he
asked, raising his glass.</p>

<p>Five other glasses shimmered in
the candlelight.</p>

<p>"Let us, ah, toast success to the
unveiling of the rotten Martian
who sits among us, shall we?"
Heidel's smile glinted and he drank
a quarter of his glass.</p>

<p>The five glasses tipped and were
returned to the table. Again there
was silence as the men waited.</p>

<p>"To get back," Heidel said, listening
with excitement to his own
voice. "Dr. Kingly, in the process
of an autopsy on a derelict Martian,
made a rather startling discovery ..."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," Forbes
said. "Did you say autopsy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Heidel. "We've done
this frequently. Not according to
base orders, you understand." He
winked. "But a little infraction now
and then is necessary."</p>

<p>"I see," said Forbes. "I just didn't
know about that."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't, did you?" said
Heidel, looking at Forbes closely.
"At any rate, Dr. Kingly had developed
in his work a preserving
solution which he used in such
instances, thereby prolonging the
time for examination of the cadaver,
without experiencing deterioration
of the tissues. This
solution was merely injected into
the blood stream, and ..."</p>

<p>"Sorry again, sir," Forbes said.
"But you said blood stream?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Heidel nodded. "This
had to be done before the cadaver
was a cadaver, you see?"</p>

<p>"I think so, yes," said Forbes,
leaning back again. "Murdered the
bastard for an autopsy, what?"</p>

<p>Heidel's fingers closed around
the pistol. "I don't like that,
Forbes."</p>

<p>"Terribly sorry, sir."</p>

<p>"To get on," Heidel said finally,
his voice a cutting sound. "Dr.
Kingly had injected his solution
and then ... Well, at any rate,
when he returned to his laboratory,
it was night. His laboratory was
black as pitch&mdash;I'm trying to paint
the picture for you, gentlemen&mdash;and
the cadaver was stretched out
on a table, you see. And before Dr.
Kingly switched on the lights, he
saw the eyes of this dead Martian
glowing in the dark like a pair of
hot coals."</p>

<p>"Weird," said Sadler, unblinking.</p>

<p>"Ghostly," said Clarke.</p>

<p>"The important thing," Heidel
said curtly, "is that Dr. Kingly
discovered the difference, then,
between the Martian and the
Earthman. The difference is the
eyes. The solution, you see, had
reacted chemically to the membranes
of the eyeballs, so that as it
happened they lit up like electric
lights. I won't go into what Dr.
Kingly found further, when he dissected
the eyeballs. Let it suffice to
say, the Martian eyeball is a physical
element entirely different from
our own&mdash;at least from those of five
of us, I should say."</p>

<p>His grin gleamed. He was working
this precisely and carefully, and
it was effective. "Now, however,"
he continued, "it is this <i>sixth</i> man
who is at issue right now. The fly
in the soup, shall we say. And in
just a few seconds I am going to
exterminate that fly."</p>

<p>He picked up the pistol from the
table. "As I told you, gentlemen, I
am quite versatile with this weapon.
I am a dead shot, in other
words. And I am going to demonstrate
it to you." He glanced from
face to face.</p>

<p>"You will notice that since Mr.
Meehan has moved, I have a clear
field across the table. I don't believe
a little lead in the woodwork
will mar the room too much, would
you say, Forbes?"</p>

<p>Forbes sat very still. "No, I
shouldn't think so, sir."</p>

<p>"Good. Because I am going to
snuff out each of the four candles
in the center of this table by shooting
the wick away. You follow me,
gentlemen? Locke? Meehan? Sadler?"</p>

<p>Heads nodded.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you are already
ahead of me. When the last candle
is extinguished, we will have darkness,
you see. And then I think we'll
find our Martian rat. Because, as
a matter of fact," Heidel lolled his
words, "I have taken the privilege
of adding to the wine we have been
drinking Dr. Kingly's preserving solution.
Non-tasteful, non-harmful.
Except, that is, to one man in this
room."</p>

<p>Heidel motioned his gun. "And
God rest the bastard's soul, because
if you will remember, I have five
bullets in the chamber of this pistol.
Four for the candles and one for
the brain of the sonofabitch whose
eyes light up when the last candle
goes out."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There was</span> a steady deadly
silence while the flames of the
candles licked at the still air.</p>

<p>"I think, however," Heidel said,
savoring the moment, "that we
should have one final toast before
we proceed." He lifted his glass.
"May the receiver of the fifth bullet
go straight to hell. I phrase that
literally, gentlemen," he said, laughing.
"Drink up!"</p>

<p>The glasses were drained and
placed again on the table.</p>

<p>"Watch carefully," Heidel said
and lifted the pistol. He aimed at
the first candle. The trigger was
taut against his finger, the explosion
loud in the room.</p>

<p>"One," said Heidel.</p>

<p>He aimed again. The explosion.</p>

<p>"Two," he said. "Rather good,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Sadler said.</p>

<p>"Quite," said Forbes.</p>

<p>"Again," said Heidel. A third
shot echoed.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, pointing the
muzzle at the last candle. "I would
say this is it, wouldn't you, gentlemen?
And as soon as this one goes,
I'm afraid one of us is going to
find a bullet right between his goddam
sparkling eyes. Are you
ready?"</p>

<p>He squinted one eye and looked
down the sights. He squeezed the
trigger, the room echoed and there
was blackness. Heidel held his pistol
poised over the table.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Well," said Forbes finally.
"There you have it. Surprise,
what?"</p>

<p>Heidel balanced the pistol, feeling
his palm go suddenly moist
against the black grip, and he
looked around at the five pairs of
glowing eyes.</p>

<p>"Bit of a shock, I should imagine,"
Forbes said. "Discovering
all of us, as it were."</p>

<p>Heidel licked his lips. "How?
<i>How</i> could you do this?"</p>

<p>Forbes remained motionless.
"Simple as one, you know. Put men
on rockets going back to Earth in
place of returning colonists. Study.
Observe. Learn. Shift a record here
and there. Forge, change pictures,
all that sort of thing. Poor contact
between here and Earth, you
know. Not too difficult."</p>

<p>"I'll get one of you," Heidel said,
still balancing his pistol tightly.</p>

<p>"Well, possibly," Forbes said.
"But no more than one. You have
three guns pointed at you. We can
see you perfectly, you know, as
though it were broad daylight. One
shiver of that pistol, and you're
dead."</p>

<p>"Why have you done this?"
Heidel said suddenly. "<i>Why?</i>
Everything that was done was for
the Martian. We tried to give you
freedom and culture, the benefit of
our knowledge...."</p>

<p>"We didn't like your wrestlers,"
Forbes said.</p>

<p>Heidel's nostrils twitched, and
suddenly he swung the pistol. There
was a crashing explosion and then
silence.</p>

<p>"Good," said Forbes. "I don't
think he got the last one fired."</p>

<p>"You're all right then?" asked
Meehan, putting his gun on the
table.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite! Rather dramatic altogether,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Nerve tingling," Locke agreed.</p>

<p>Forbes turned in his chair and
called, "Oh, Kessit!"</p>

<p>The butler opened the door to
the darkened room, hesitated, and
reached for the light switch.</p>

<p>"No, no," Forbes said, smiling.
"Never mind that. Come over here,
will you please?"</p>

<p>The butler crossed the room
slowly.</p>

<p>"It's all right," Forbes said. "The
president will notice nothing whatever,
Kessit. Would you mind pouring
us all another glass of wine?
I'm frightfully crazy about that
port, eh?"</p>

<p>There was a murmur of agreeing
voices. The butler lifted the silver
decanter and filled glasses, moving
easily and surely in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Cheers," said Forbes.</p>

<p>"Cheers," said the others, over
the clink of glasses.</p>
